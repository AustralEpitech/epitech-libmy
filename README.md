# Useful_stuff

In this repo, you will find a main lib (with tests in tests_lib), a script to
create Epitech repositories from the `repo` template and a lib for linked
lists. This last lib is not automated as it was made using the glibc functions,
it is mostly for tech2 projects.

## Quick start

```console
./new_proj name [repo]
```
